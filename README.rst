Crawlinsta
==========

Introduction
------------
A python package for crawling instagram based on [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io)
and [selenium-wire](https://github.com/wkeeling/selenium-wire). The idea is to use selenium
to trigger the javascript in browser to send requests to the server for a specific action,
and meanwhile selenium-wire will keep tracking on the network and capture the responses
for data extraction purpose.
